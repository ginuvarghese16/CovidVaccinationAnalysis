The dataset contains the details of the COVID-19 vaccination of 61 countries from 2020-2021.The data was
collected from the Kaggle. There were 13 variables in the original dataset and 5750 observations. The data has the
vaccination count and also the rate of vaccination per population of the country. As a part of cleaning and for analysis
purpose I added 3 additional variables to the dataset. Finally, it had 16 variables and 5750 observations. The data is based
on daily vaccinations on different dates in the time period 2020 â€“ 2021. The details of fully vaccinated people and total
vaccinations and the type vaccines used in each country are available in the dataset.
